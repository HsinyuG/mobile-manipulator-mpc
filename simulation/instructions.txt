Instructions to run:

1. Follow the instructions and download the code from https://github.com/maxspahn/gym_envs_urdf
2. Navigate to the gym_envs_urdf folder
3. Create and navigate to a new folder within gym_envs_urdf
4. Copy the files from this folder in the new folder
5. Run the run_simulation.py script

Some notes:

- In the run function in run_simulation.py, the simulation is ran in single steps,
  This means that we could do something here with the 'observation' that is returned
- You can change the parameters for the  simulation environment
- It is now set to the 'vel' (velocity) mode,
  but you can also use 'acc' (acceleration) or 'tor' (torque)
- The obstacles are defined in obstacles.py
  I now just defined some examples manually,
  but I'm planning to make a function for creating obstacles
